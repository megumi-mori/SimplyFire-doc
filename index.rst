Welcome to SimplyFire's documentation!
======================================

SimplyFire is a Python-based software to analyze electrophysiology data.
The package includes a GUI that can be opened from a .exe file
and standalone Python packages that can be imported independently of the GUI.
The pre-made templates allow for easy creation of new modules.

Check out the :doc:`Installation` section for how to get started with
using SimplyFire for analysis.

The documentation for SimplyFire is hosted on Read the Docs.
